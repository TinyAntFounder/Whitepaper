# ðŸª™ Tokenomics

When you purchase a Tiny Ant or $CRUMB tokens, you are not only buying a JPEG or an avatar - you are buying yourself a membership card that gives you access to the most exclusive Colony in the world. Your Tiny Ant will open doors for you that you have never seen before.

The Tiny Colony will be operational after the public mint Is 100% sold out. It gives access to wallets holding minimum one Tiny Ant. The Colony is the place to hang out with Tiny Ants friends, discuss the next events, eat some exquisite bread crumbs and .

With every Tiny Ant sold we have applied a royalty of 10% and 2.5% goes to buy back the token ðŸš€ and burnðŸ”¥. If royalties apply, a 10% royalty fee will stand, and 2.5% goes to buybacks and ðŸ”¥ In the situation we receive platform token airdrops (BLUR), these will be sold to support the same ðŸ”¥ mechanics.
